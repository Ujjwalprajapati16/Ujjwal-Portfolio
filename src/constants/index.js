export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hello! I'm Ujjwal Prajapati, a tech enthusiast and driven software developer with a passion for building solutions that bring real value to users. I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology (BTech) in Computer Science at LNCT University in Bhopal. From a young age, I've been fascinated by how technology shapes our world, and this curiosity evolved into a deep commitment to mastering my craft.

I’m known for my dedication to continuous learning, always striving to sharpen my skills in core programming languages like Python and JavaScript. My journey has been enriched by hands-on experience with APIs, data structures, and various frameworks that allow me to develop scalable, efficient, and user-centered applications.

Beyond academics, I am also actively involved in team projects and competitions, where I’ve had the opportunity to showcase my leadership and collaborative abilities. Recently, I had the honor of contributing to a project that won second place at a prestigious startup idea pitching event. This experience taught me a lot about teamwork, communication, and innovation—all qualities I carry into my everyday work.

When it comes to skills, I am proficient in full-stack development, specializing in back-end technologies like Node.js and databases such as MongoDB and MySQL. I also have certifications in API development and advanced software engineering, which give me a strong foundation in creating seamless, reliable, and scalable web applications. I’m especially excited about the possibilities within Back-End Web Development and am constantly exploring how I can use my skills to make a lasting impact in tech and education.

Outside of my coding life, I enjoy staying active, exploring new technologies, and diving into open-source projects. These hobbies not only keep me engaged but also help me stay connected to a wider tech community where I can learn and contribute meaningfully.`;
